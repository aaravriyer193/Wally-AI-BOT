# Wally-AI-BOT
A simple, interactive chatbot that uses browser-based voice recognition and speech synthesis to communicate. Wally's SVG face changes expression based on the state of the conversation, creating a more engaging user experience. The project uses a serverless Netlify Function to securely connect to the OpenAI API.
